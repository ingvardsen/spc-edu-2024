# From Perplexity

This implementation includes the following features:

    1. A game board rendered on an HTML canvas
    2. Basic Tetris pieces (I, L, J, O, T, S, Z)
    3. Piece movement (left, right, down) and rotation
    4. Collision detection
    5. Line clearing and scoring
    6. Game over detection

The game uses Tailwind CSS for styling, which is included via a CDN link in the HTML file. The JavaScript file (tetris.js) contains all the game logic.

To play the game:

    1. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the piece horizontally
    2. Use the down arrow key to move the piece down faster
    3. Use the 'Q' key to rotate the piece counterclockwise
    4. Use the 'W' key to rotate the piece clockwise

The game starts when you click the "Start Game" button. The score is updated as you clear lines.

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a Tetris game. You can further enhance it by adding features like:

    1. A "next piece" preview
    2. Increasing difficulty (faster drop speed) as the score increases
    3. Improved graphics and animations
    4. Sound effects and background music
    5. High score tracking using local storage

Remember that this is a basic implementation and may require further refinement and testing for a production-ready game[1][2][3].
