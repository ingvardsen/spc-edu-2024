I've created a simple platform game using HTML and JavaScript. Here's a breakdown of the game:
  * The game is rendered on an HTML5 canvas element.
  * The player character is a blue square that can move left and right using the arrow keys, and jump using the up arrow key.
  * There's a green platform at the bottom of the screen that the player can stand on and jump from.
  * The goal is a red square on the right side of the screen. Reaching it wins the game and resets the player position.
  * Basic physics (gravity and jumping) are implemented.

To play the game:

  * Use the left and right arrow keys to move the blue square (player) left and right.
  * Press the up arrow key to make the player jump.
  * Try to reach the red square (goal) on the right side of the screen.

This is a basic implementation, but it demonstrates the core concepts of a platform game. You can expand on this by adding multiple platforms, obstacles, or more complex game mechanics.
